# Introduction
![Vuepress Build](https://github.com/OE-O/Documentation/workflows/Vuepress%20Build/badge.svg)  
Welcome to the OE-O API guide!
## How It Works
The API is a basic REST-API, you collect data by using web requests and other methods.

The documentation will document all methods using an example like the below:

### GET

<RouteHighlighter method="GET" route="/this/is/a/fake/route/:abc123?abc123="/> 

| Variable  | Example 	| Description      	|
|---------	|---------	|------------------	|
| :abc123 	| abc123  	| A url paramater. 	|
| ?abc123 	| abc123  	| A query.         	|
